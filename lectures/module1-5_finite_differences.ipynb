    "This lecture introduces **finite-difference grids**, notation, and the construction of **difference approximations** to PDEs. We also show basic **boundary-condition treatments** and immediately implement a first solver to build numerical intuition. Some of the material of this section is largely based on the [Thomas (1998), **Numerical Partial Differential Equations: Finite Difference Methods**](https://link-springer-com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7278-1) book."
